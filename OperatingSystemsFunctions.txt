One of the functions of an operating system is the print controlling function. This function helps the device keep track
of what is being printed. Say you print more than one thing at a time, this function will enusre that the pages printed
will be in order and seperate, not just a jumbled mess of whatever you're printing.

Another function of an operating system is data security. This function ensure that the data on a computer is safe from
ouside use. Sometimes data can be used for illegal activites or modified or deleted, this function ensures data is protected
from that.

A third function of an operating system is the loading and execution function. Two things need to happen in order to run
a program on a computer, it needs to be loaded onto the computer and then executed. This function allows for both to happen
so that programs can be run on the computer.
